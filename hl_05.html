            <p class="title">The Turnip</p>
            <p>06 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The king accepted his present, and said he had nothing to give him in return that was more rare and excellent than the great turnip.

There, he did not know on whom to vent his rage and anger, until bad thoughts came to him, and he resolved to kill his brother.</p>

When Two-Eyes saw that, she went out full of sadness, seated herself on the ridge of grass at the edge of the field, and wept bitter tears.</p>
