            <p>02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once on a time when the girl had gone out, her mother said, cook, little pot, cook.  And it did cook and she ate till she was satisfied, and then she wanted the pot to stop cooking, but did not know the word.</p>
            
            <p>So it went on cooking and the porridge rose</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
    

            <p>over</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>the edge, </p>
            <p>and still it cooked on </p>
            <p>until the kitchen and whole house were full, </p>
            <p>and then the next house, </p>
            <p>and then the whole street, </p>
            <p>just as if it wanted to satisfy </p>
            <p>the hunger of the whole world, </p>
            <p>and there was the greatest distress, </p>
            <p>but no one knew how to stop it. </p>
