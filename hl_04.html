What strange thing is this, said the king.  Many wonderful things have come before my eyes, but never such a monster as this.  From what seed can this have sprung, or are you a favorite of good fortune and have met with it by chance.  Ah, no, said the farmer, no favorite am I.  I am a poor soldier, who because he could no longer support himself hung his soldier's coat on a nail and took to farming land.  I have a brother who is rich and well known to you, lord king, but I, because I have nothing, am forgotten by everyone. Then the king felt compassion for him, and said, you shall be raised from your poverty, and shall have such gifts from me that you shall be equal to your rich brother.  Then he bestowed on him much gold, and lands, and meadows, and herds, and made him immensely rich, so that the wealth of the other brother could not be compared with his.</p>
